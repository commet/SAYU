# SAYU Backend Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Done

1. **Created .env file** with secure passwords and configuration
2. **Updated docker-compose.yml** to match the passwords
3. **Created missing database scripts**:
   - `src/scripts/setupDatabase.js` - Initializes database schema
   - `src/scripts/seedData.js` - Seeds sample data and creates demo user
4. **Started Docker containers** for PostgreSQL and Redis
5. **Initialized database** with schema and sample data
6. **Server is running** with real database connections

## Server Status

✅ Server is running on port 3001
✅ PostgreSQL is running in Docker
✅ Redis is running in Docker
✅ Database initialized with schema
✅ Demo user created
✅ Health endpoint working: http://localhost:3001/api/health
✅ Authentication working (tested login)

## Next Steps

### For Production Setup (with Docker):

1. Install Docker Desktop and enable WSL2 integration
2. Run Docker containers:
   ```bash
   cd /home/yclee913/sayu/backend
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Initialize database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   npm run db:seed
   ```
4. Start production server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### For Development (current setup):

The server is currently running with mock services. This is suitable for:
- Frontend development
- API testing
- Understanding the structure

### Demo Credentials

When database is properly set up:
- Email: demo@sayu.art
- Password: demo123

### Important Notes

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Add your real OpenAI API key in .env file
2. **Security**: Change JWT_SECRET before production deployment
3. **Database**: The mock setup doesn't persist data - use real PostgreSQL for production

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/`:

- `/api/health` - Health check ✅
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- `/api/auth/login` - User login
- `/api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `/api/quiz/start` - Start quiz session
- `/api/quiz/answer` - Submit quiz answer
- `/api/quiz/complete` - Complete quiz
- `/api/profile` - Get user profile
- `/api/agent/chat` - AI curator chat
- `/api/recommendations` - Get art recommendations
- `/api/reflections` - User reflections
- `/api/artworks` - Browse artworks
- `/api/analytics` - User analytics

## Architecture

The backend follows a clean architecture:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services**: Business logic (OpenAI integration)
- **Models**: Data access layer
- **Routes**: API endpoint definitions
- **Middleware**: Auth, validation, rate limiting
- **Config**: Database and Redis connections

The system is designed for scalability with proper separation of concerns, caching strategy, and AI integration.
